= About this site =

== Getting in touch ==

== Missing content? ==
Most NeIC information is published on the [http://wiki.neic.no NeIC wiki]. If you cannot find what you are loking for in either of these sites, please [http://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Contact contact us].

== Technical information ==
The main part of this site is static HTML pages compiled from Mediawiki-formatted source files. We keep all these files in a Git repository on GitHub and use the [http://jekyllrb.com/ Jekyll] site compiler to build the final web site. This allows us to work with the web site in a CMS-like manner with version control, without actually needing a dynamic web framework.
