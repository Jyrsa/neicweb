The overarching purpose of the bio- and medical sciences is to improve 
the human condition. This involves for example to cure disease and 
improve quality of life, or counteract societal risks like pollution 
and overperscription. While these disciplines have not traditionally 
been very computer-intensive, recent technical innovations are 
expected to push requirements for data storage and processing into the 
Exa-scale (billions of Gb) within the near future. Also, in many of 
the most relevant applications for us humans, this data often concerns 
highly sensitive information on individuals, like medical diagnoses or 
smoking habits, so research into these topics must be done with highest 
possible regard to security, integrity and ethics.

NeIC BMS coordinates Nordic efforts for providing world-class services 
to support researchers facing these challenges, to build a better tomorrow.
