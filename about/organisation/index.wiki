= Organisation =

The NeIC Board is responsible for setting priorities for the NeIC, and 
reports to the NordForsk Board annually and otherwise on request.

Activities are organised into four areas with dedicated area coordinators: 
the Tier-1 service, Bio- and Medical Sciences, Generic Services, and 
Administration. Projects are developed within each area in collaboration 
with national partner institutions on a cost-sharing basis. New areas may 
emerge in the future.

In collaboration with Nordic universities and institutions, the NeIC 
employs IT experts in keeping with the requirements of the Nordic user 
communities.

Area coordinators reach out to and involve users and the national 
e-Infrastructure provider organisations via dedicated stakeholder forums 
to guide the development of services within the individual activity areas.
