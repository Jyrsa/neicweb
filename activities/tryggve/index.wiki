Tryggve is a three-year project to establish a Nordic platform for
collaboration on sensitive data, funded by NeIC and the ELIXIR nodes in
Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. The approach in the project is to utilize
and connect existing capacities and services at the Nordic countries. The work
is conducted in close collaboration with the user communities and Nordic
e-infrastructure providers.

Need for a cross-border collaboration on handling of sensitive biomedical
research data became evident from the several suggestions received by NeIC in
its 2012 call for letters of interest. Tryggve is here to respond to this
demand.

The project aims to provide researchers a trusted set of services to share and
analyze sensitive biomedical data, across Nordic countries.

The name of the project ''Tryggve'' is a Nordic name that stems from Old Norse
"tryggr", which was used to mean "trusty, faithful, true, safe", just as the
word "trygg" still does in most Nordic languages.
