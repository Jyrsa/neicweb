<h1> Past trainings </h1>

<p> This page contains past events from the NeIC <a href="https://wiki.neic.no/wiki/Training">training calendar</a>, which includes both NeIC training and stakeholder training which NeIC either participates in or simply wants to advertize. You may also want to look for <a href="/events">current training events</a>.

var calendarid = "ouebfn9g5muu6l7vjd9hhf0lp4%40group.calendar.google.com";
var key = "AIzaSyDs9SxBwa14qoanXOaKNGWh-6Hq62ky4oQ";
var widget = document.scripts[document.scripts.length - 1].parentNode;
renderEvents(widget, calendarid, key, true, "", "");
