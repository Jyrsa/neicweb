'''Do you have a deep knowledge of software development for the scientific community? We are looking for a self-motivated software specialist with excellent communication and collaboration skills.'''

The Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration (NeIC) is seeking a Project Manager/Software Specialist for the project '''"Collaborative Infrastructure for Scientific Software development"'''

Software development is at the core of eScience research. Advances in hardware technology and computational algorithms put substantial pressure on software developers. Thus fast, efficient and reliable development cycles directly affect the speed and quality of e-Science work. Yet experience shows that a large number of academic research groups develop in-house software using inefficient and outdated methodologies.

Main elements of the project are deployment of the infrastructure, organization of training activities and the creation of a Nordic-wide network of application experts. The current announcement is for a project manager (PM) for this project.
