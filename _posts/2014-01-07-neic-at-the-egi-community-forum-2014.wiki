'''NeIC will participate at the EGI Community Forum 19 to 23 May 2014.'''

NeIC, the Nordic e-Infrastructure Collaboration, is facilitating the development of advanced IT tools and services in areas of importance to Nordic researchers. In order to fill the gap between the successful NeIC2013 conference with its popular workshop session and the next big NeIC conference in 2015, some of the current activities going on in Nordic collaboration in the field of e-infrastructure and the handling of scientific data will be presented and can be discussed actively at the EGI Community Forum 2014.

The EGI Community Forum 2014 will take place in Helsinki from 19 to 23 May 2014; the event will be hosted by EGI.eu in partnership with the University of Helsinki and the CSC-IT Centre for Science Ltd.

The Community Forum 2014 has as leading theme "Advancing excellent science" and includes a new richer set of user-orientated tracks that will provide opportunities to existing and new user communities to present their requirements, report on success stories, get support in porting their application environment to the EGI grid and cloud services and network with technical providers and other partners.
