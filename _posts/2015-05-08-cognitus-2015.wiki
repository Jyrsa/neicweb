The report was commissioned by NeIC and prepared by an external expert, Dr. Rob Pennington, Deputy Director of the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign.

Among Penningtons recommendations are an expanded role for NeIC and an international HPC-programme incorporated into national strategies.
