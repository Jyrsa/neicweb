'''Do you want to be a part of our team? NeIC is seeking two new system administrators to join the virtual NT1 team.'''

The Nordic WLCG Tier-1 (NT1) is a unique virtual site within WLCG which aggregates super computing resources from DeIC (Denmark), UNINETT Sigma (Norway), SNIC (Sweden) and CSC (Finland). The virtual site is developed, maintained and operated by a small and dedicated virtual team of system administrators and software developers.

NT1 will soon extend its portfolio to offer a new Operator on Duty service. The service oversees the daily operation of not only the Nordic Tier-1, but of all EGI (European Grid Initiative) sites in the Nordic and Baltic area. As part of this service extension, NeIC is seeking two new system administrators to join the virtual NT1 team.

The ideal candidates are self-motivated technical experts with good communication and collaboration skills that are comfortable working in virtual teams with little face-to-face contact. The new team members report to the NT1 Area Coordinator and are expected to have 50% of their time committed to the NT1. The remaining time should be committed to their home institution at one of the participating sites.

The positions have a term of up to two years, with the possibility of extension. Applications including CV should be submitted to [mailto:neic@nordforsk.org neic@nordforsk.org] within August 22nd.

Questions about the position may be directed to Gerd Behrmann, Acting NT1 Area Coordinator, tel. +45 60626435, [mailto:behrmann@ndgf.org behrmann@ndgf.org].
