Well this is embarrasing. 

The NeIC webserver is supposed to replace this with the conference website 
for the NeIC all-hands meeting 2016.

If you see this on the NeIC webserver (outside of GitHub) then something has gone wrong, 
and please would you be so kind as to [[mailto:joel@nsc.liu.se|let us know]] so we can fix it?
